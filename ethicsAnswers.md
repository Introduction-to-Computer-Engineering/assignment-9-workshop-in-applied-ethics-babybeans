# Workshop in Applied Ethics
## Answer the Questions

#### 1. If all people were ethical in all their interactions, which centerpiece of modern society would be obviated?
   - The justice system would be unnecessary if there were no unethical behavoirs.

#### 2. Ethics creates a dichotomy between the comfort of the individual and the longevity, or mere existance, of the group. Give an example of an extreme case from recent history that favored the group to the detriment of the individual. How would you embed the principle of balance of the interests of the individual and the group into the ethical code itself? Be specific.
   - The recent example that comes to mind would be the industrial revolution in the United States of America. The Industrial Revolution did benefit the group, but the conditions inside the factories and the living conditions of the workers in the cities were terrible. 

#### 3. (BONUS) Ethical codes are vulnerable to the tragedy of the commons. An ethical code relies on the cooperation of the individuals. Discuss how rogue behavior (aka defection) with respect to the ethical code of a group gives rise to the prisoner's dilemma and the eventual demise of the ethical code. What incentives can you build in the ethical code that would counteract the attractiveness of defection and, as a result, would mitigate the danger to the code?  
   
   - A way to incentivize employees, is to hold random checks on random employees to make sure our code of ethics is being upheld. If after the check it is found that they are being upheld, provide a monetary award, because most of the time a person might be unethical is due to greed and greed being a product of money. Also if employees pass inspections, they will be more eligable to raises and promotions. We would also use technilogical mutation to change the frequency of the of the access to certain levels of security to prevent unauthorized access to data. Some incentives for following the code of ethics could be company wide recognition or a small monetary gift.
    
   ##### ii) Preventing rogues in our company because this type of behavior can derail the entire company and cause the downfall of the whole group. 
   a) We will have multiple layers of access and authority in our company. 
   b) We will have technological mutation, which includes using randomized systems to ensure that no person stays in a position for too long.
   
 
  ## Class Activities

#### 1) In a small group up to 5 people, imagine you are a small tech startup. 
   ##### i) Members:
   Leean Woo,
   Vincent Feil,
   Jessica Gardner,
   Joaquin Trujillo,
   Bruce Liu
   
   ##### ii) Choose a President: 
   Vincent Feil
   
   ##### iii) Choose a tech product:
   Computer that can run any Operating System/Software 
   
#### 2) Describe the ways your innovation, if realized, would affect society.

  ##### i) Below, list at least 3 adverse effects (including but not limited to misuse) of the innovation and anticipatory actions and mechanisms you can embed.
  
  Adverse effects: 
  a) It hinders ability to adapt to different softwares/UI.
  b) It would affect the job market due to companies losing proprietary ownership of specific products.
  c) It would force custoemrs to discard old laptops adding on to the harm of our environment.
  
  Helpful effects: 
  a) It would provide economic freedom for the individual.
  b)It would add ease in the evelopement of new products. 
  
  ##### ii) Below, give an explicit definition of the fine line between the benefit and detriment of your innovation at two moments of its lifetime: (a) immediately upon launch; (b) after enough time for it to be absorbed into everyday life.  
   a. Immediately upon launch: It would cause a spike in laptops being thrown away and cause excess waste and impact on the enviornment 
   b. After enough time for it to be absorbed into everyday life: We would lose the ability to adapt to different softwares or User Interfaces. 
     
#### 3)  Your small "band of merry psychopaths" are the pivotal social kernel that can define the proper use of your technology. You have to start early, and hold the line. How are you going to ensure that you stay the course?
   - By making use of a Code of Conduct
  ##### i) Below, define a Code of Ethics (aka Code of Conduct) for your organization that will safeguard your original intentions and values while not stiflying innovation as your startup grows and matures. Your code should have at most 9 points. 
  
  1. Follow copyright laws, our work will be honest and original. 
     No products we design or build will violate any laws or regulations that apply.
  2. Be transparent, let the user know exactly what data/information we are recieving and taking.
     All information gathered by the company will be secure and used only for the purposes stated. We will never sell or otherwise
     compromise customer or supplier infomation.
  3. All employees and officers of the company will avoid conflics of interest.
     No employee of the company will engage in any activity that is in conflict with the goals of the company. Further more no employee with 
     hold employment of any kind with a competing company or a company we do business with. 
  4. No employee will accept or convey a bribery. 
     No employee will accept or give lavish gifts to or from anyone we do business with. Lavish is defined as anything with a monitary
     value over ($100.00) one hundred dollars. 
  5. Our product/software will be accessible to everyone who seeks it.
     Our product is intended to help people every where. To this end we will not discriminate in any way against anyone. 
  6. Our employees are the heart of our business and will treat each other with respect, fairness, and equality.
     No employee will create a hostile uncomfortable environment for any other employee. 
     Passionate, efficient and skilled people make a significant contribution to our success. We expect and
     promote an entrepreneurial mindset, innovative thinking, people taking initiative, reliability and a sense of
     responsibility.
  7. Customers will be treated with respect, fairness, equally, and with diligence.
     Without customers we have no business, therfore each customer will recieve the same service and care we expect ourselves.
     Our customer service will have the same high quality standards as our products.
  8. Honor customer confidientiality.
     We will never sell or otherwise compromise customer or suppier infomation.
  9. Produce highest quality possible.
     The pursuit of quality is core to our approach in everything we do. 
     Our products are designed and built to the highest technical standards and offer excellent functionality and ease of
     use.  
     
     
#### 3) (BONUS) Ethical codes are vulnerable to hostile takeover of the adopting organization. Pick one person from your group and let them remove 3 points from your Code, at their discretion, to be the most damaging overall. 
  1. Follow copyright laws, our work will be honest and original  **Choice for deletion exploit**
  2. Be transparent, let the user know exactly what data/information we are recieving and taking  **Choice for deletion exploit**
  3. All employees and officers of the company will avoid conflic of interest. 
  4. No employee will accept or convey a bribe.  **Choice for deletion exploit**
  5. Our product/software will be accessible to everyone who seeks it. 
  6. Employees will treat each other will respect, fairness, and equally. 
  7. Customers will be trated with respect, fairness, equally, and with dilligence. 
  8. Honor customer confidientiality
  9. Produce highest quality possible
  
  ##### i)Below, discuss how and why the Code has been weakened.
   a) *Follow copyright laws, our work will be honest and original.* 
Removing this point would make production faster but lose public trust, at least in the United States of America. It also opens opportunity for litigation.
   b) *Be transparent, let the user know exactly what data/information we are receiving and taking.*
Removing this point would make it to where actions could be done in stealth. This allows for data mining and selling information, which is very valuble.  A person that is also breaking this rule would have the ablity to uncover it. Without  this point, it opens up opportunity for litigation and also loses public trust.
   c) *No employee will accept or convey a bribe.* 
Removing this point would allow the person or company to be bought out. We would lose control of the mission and any ethics we hope to preserve. This would also make the company lose public trust.     
 
  ##### ii) Below, discuss how, in retrospect, you should have stated the points of the Code, to make it robust to disruption. Note: Beware of the paradox of self-amendment, which, in short, "...arises when a rule is used as the authority for its own amendment. It is sharper when the rule of change is supreme, sharper still when it is changed into a form that is inconsistent with its original form, and sharpest of all when the change purports to be irrevocable."
   - We could give an exact definition for what is expected from the employees, adding detail and specifics, as well as a general definition of each point in our code.
