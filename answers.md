1. If all people were ethical in all their interactions, which centerpiece of modern society would be obviated?
   - The justice system would be unnecessary if there were no unethical behavoirs.

2. Ethics creates a dichotomy between the comfort of the individual and the longevity, or mere existance, of the group. Give an example of an extreme case from recent history that favored the group to the detriment of the individual. How would you embed the principle of balance of the interests of the individual and the group into the ethical code itself? Be specific.
   - The recent example that comes to mind would be the industrial revolution in the United States of America. The Industrial Revolution did benefit the group, but the conditions inside the factories and the living conditions of the workers in the cities were terrible. 

3. (BONUS) Ethical codes are vulnerable to the tragedy of the commons. 
An ethical code relies on the cooperation of the individuals. Discuss how rogue behavior 
(aka defection) with respect to the ethical code of a group gives rise to the prisoner's 
dilemma and the eventual demise of the ethical code. What incentives can you build in the 
ethical code that would counteract the attractiveness of defection and, as a result, would mitigate the danger to the code?
